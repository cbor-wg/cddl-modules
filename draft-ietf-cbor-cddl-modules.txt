Abstract

   At the time of writing, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   is defined by RFC 8610 and RFC 9165.  The latter has used the
   extension point provided in RFC 8610, the _control operator_.

   As CDDL is being used in larger projects, the need for features has
   become known that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension
   point.

   The present document defines a backward- and forward-compatible way
   to add a module structure to CDDL.

1.  Introduction

   At the time of writing, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   is defined by RFC 8610 and RFC 9165.  The latter has used the
   extension point provided in RFC 8610, the _control operator_.

   As CDDL is being used in larger projects, the need for features has
   become known that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension
   point.

   The present document defines a backward- and forward-compatible way
   to add a module structure to CDDL.

   The functionality of the present document is considered a core part
   of what has colloquially been called CDDL 2.0, and is intended to be
   used with (and orthogonal to) other recent specifications such as a
   small set of CDDL grammar updates [I-D.ietf-cbor-update-8610-grammar]
   and an additional exercise of the control operator extension point
   [I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl-more-control] (a follow-up to [RFC9165]).

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The Terminology from [RFC8610] applies.

   Some examples use CDDL definitions from [RFC9052].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Module superstructure

   _Compatibility_:  bidirectional (both backward and forward)

   Originally, CDDL was used for small data models that could be
   expressed in a few lines.  As the size of data models that need to be
   expressed in CDDL has increased, the need to modularize and re-use
   components is increasing.

Internet-Draft            CDDL Module Structure               March 2025


   CDDL as documented in [RFC8610] (_basic CDDL_) has been designed with
   a crude form of composition: Concatenating a number of CDDL snippets
   creates a valid CDDL data model unless there is a name collision
   (_identical_ redefinition is allowed to facilitate this approach).
   With larger models, managing the overall name space to avoid
   collisions becomes more pressing.

   In CDDL's original composition model, the knowledge which CDDL
   snippets need to be concatenated in order to obtain the desired data
   model lives entirely outside the CDDL snippets.  With the module
   structure defined in the present document, rule sets are packaged as
   modules and referenced from other modules, providing methods for
   control of namespace pollution.

   Further work may be expended on unambiguous referencing into evolving
   specifications ("versioning") and selection of alternatives (as was
   emulated with snippets in Section 11 of [RFC8428].  Note that one
   approach for expressing variants is demonstrated in [useful] based on
   Section 4 of [RFC9165]).  Potential further work is outlined in
   Sections 4 and A.2 of [I-D.bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft].

2.1.  Compatibility

   To achieve the module structure in a way that is friendly to existing
   environments that operate with CDDL and basic CDDL implementations,
   we add a super-syntax (similar to the way pragmas are often added to
   a language), by carrying them in _directives_. Directives are parsed
   as comments in basic CDDL, so that each module source file can at the
   same time be basic CDDL on its own.  This enables forward
   compatibility: a single file can be designed to serve both as valid
   basic CDDL and as a module with directives that specify how
   additional rule definitions are to be imported from other source
   files.

   This bidirectional compatibility is useful to allow CDDL model
   designers to start using directives before the bulk of the tools that
   process CDDL has been updated to implement the present specification.

2.2.  Namespacing

   When importing rules from other modules, there is the potential for
   name collisions.  This is exacerbated when the modules evolve, which
   may lead to the introduction of a name into an imported module that
   is also used (likely in a different way) in the importing module.

   To be able to manage names in such a way that collisions can be
   avoided, we introduce means to prepend a prefix to the names of rules
   being imported: the "as" clause.

2.3.  "Directives", the "module"

   This specification introduces _directives_ into CDDL.  A single CDDL
   file becomes a _module_ by processing the (zero or more) directives
   in it.

   The semantics of the module are independent of the module(s) using
   it, however, importing a module may involve transforming its rule
   names into a new namespace (Section 2.2).

   Directives are parsed as comments in basic CDDL, so they do not
   interfere with forward compatibility.

   In the CDDL module structure, lines that start with the prefix ;# are
   parsed as directives.

2.4.  Naming and Finding Modules

   We assume that module names are filenames taken from one of several
   source directories available to the CDDL module structure processor
   via the environment.  This avoids the need to nail down brittle
   pathnames or (partial?)  URIs into the CDDL files.

   The exact way how these source directories and possibly a precedence
   between them are established is intentionally not fully defined in
   this specification; it is expected that this will be specified in the
   context of the models just as the way they are intended to be used
   will be.  (A more formal structure may follow later.)

   In the module structure implementation that is part of the CDDL Tool
   described in Appendix B, the set of sources is determined from an
   environment variable, CDDL_INCLUDE_PATH, which is modeled after usual
   command-line search paths.  It is a colon-separated list of pathnames
   to directories, with one special feature: an empty element points to
   the tool's own collection.  This collection contains fragments of
   extracted CDDL from published RFCs, using names such as rfc9052.

   (Future versions might augment this with Web extractors and/or ways
   to extract CDDL modules from sites such as github and from Internet-
   Drafts; see Appendix A.2 of [I-D.bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft] for some
   design considerations.)

   The default CDDL_INCLUDE_PATH is:

   .:

   That is: files are found in the current directory (.) and, if not
   found there, cddlc’s collection.

   In the examples that follow, a cddlc command line will be shown
   (starting with an isolated $ sign as in a shell command) with the
   module-structured CDDL input; the resulting basic CDDL will be shown
   separately.

2.5.  Basic Set of Directives

   Two groups of directives are defined at this point:

   *  include, which includes all the rules from a module (which
      includes the ones imported/included there, transitively), or
      specific explicitly selected rules (clause ending in "from");

   *  import, which is similar to include but includes only those rules
      from the module that are referenced from the importing module,
      implicitly or explicitly (clause ending in "from"), including the
      rules that are referenced from these rules, transitively.

   The include function is more useful for composing a single model from
   parts controlled by one author, while the import function is more
   about treating a module as a library:

   The way an import works is shown by this simple example:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   start = COSE_Key
   ;# import rfc9052

   This results in the following CDDL 1.0 specification:

   start = COSE_Key
   COSE_Key = {
     1 => tstr / int,
     ? 2 => bstr,
     ? 3 => tstr / int,
     ? 4 => [+ tstr / int],
     ? 5 => bstr,
     * label => values,
   }
   label = int / tstr
   values = any

   This is appropriate for using libraries that are well known to the
   importing specification.  However, if it is not acceptable that the
   library can pollute the namespace of the importing module, the import
   directive can specify a namespace prefix ("as" clause):

Internet-Draft            CDDL Module Structure               March 2025


   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   start = cose.COSE_Key
   ;# import rfc9052 as cose

   This results in the following CDDL 1.0 specification:

   start = cose.COSE_Key
   cose.COSE_Key = {
     1 => tstr / int,
     ? 2 => bstr,
     ? 3 => tstr / int,
     ? 4 => [+ tstr / int],
     ? 5 => bstr,
     * cose.label => cose.values,
   }
   cose.label = int / tstr
   cose.values = any

   Note how the imported names are prefixed with cose. as specified in
   the import directive, but CDDL prelude (Appendix D of [RFC8610])
   names such as tstr and any are not.

2.6.  Explicit selection of names

   Both import and include directives can be augmented by an explicit
   mentioning of rule names (clause ending in "from") or a wild-card "*"
   for all rules.

include

   Starting with include:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   mydata = {* label => values}
   ;# include label, values from rfc9052

   With include, only exactly the rules mentioned are included:

   mydata = {* label => values}
   label = int / tstr
   values = any

   The module from which rules are explicitly imported can be
   namespaced:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   mydata = {* label => values}
   ;# include cose.label, cose.values from rfc9052 as cose

Internet-Draft            CDDL Module Structure               March 2025


   Again, only exactly the rules mentioned are included:

   mydata = {* label => values}
   cose.label = int / tstr
   cose.values = any

import

   Both examples would work exactly the same with import, as the
   included rules do not reference anything else from the included
   module.

   An import however also draws in the transitive closure of the rules
   referenced:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   mydata = {Fritz: cose.empty_or_serialized_map}
   ;# import cose.empty_or_serialized_map from rfc9052 as cose

   The transitive closure of the rules mentioned is included:

   =============== NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792 ================

   mydata = {Fritz: cose.empty_or_serialized_map}
   cose.empty_or_serialized_map = bstr .cbor cose.header_map / bstr .\
                                                                  size 0
   cose.header_map = {
     cose.Generic_Headers,
     * cose.label => cose.values,
   }
   cose.Generic_Headers = (
     ? 1 => int / tstr,
     ? 2 => [+ cose.label],
     ? 3 => tstr / int,
     ? 4 => bstr,
     ? (5 => bstr // 6 => bstr),
     )
   cose.label = int / tstr
   cose.values = any

   The import statement can also request an alias for an imported name:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -
   mydata = {Fritz: cose.empty_or_serialized_map}
   ;# import empty_or_serialized_map from rfc9052 as cose

   Note how an additional rule provides an alias for
   empty_or_serialized_map that does not have the namespace prefix:

   =============== NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792 ================

   mydata = {Fritz: cose.empty_or_serialized_map}
   empty_or_serialized_map = cose.empty_or_serialized_map
   cose.empty_or_serialized_map = bstr .cbor cose.header_map / bstr .\
                                                                  size 0
   cose.header_map = {
     cose.Generic_Headers,
     * cose.label => cose.values,
   }
   cose.Generic_Headers = (
     ? 1 => int / tstr,
     ? 2 => [+ cose.label],
     ? 3 => tstr / int,
     ? 4 => bstr,
     ? (5 => bstr // 6 => bstr),
     )
   cose.label = int / tstr
   cose.values = any

2.7.  Tool Support for Command-Line Control

   Tools may provide a convenient way to initiate the processing of
   directives from the command line.

   A tool may provide a way to specify a root for the module tree from
   the command line:

   $ cddlc -2tcddl -icose=rfc9052 -scose.COSE_Key

   The command line argument -icose=rfc9052 is a shortcut for

   ;# import rfc9052 as cose

   Together with the start (root) rule name, cose.COSE_Key, supplied by
   -scose.COSE_Key, this results in the following CDDL 1.0
   specification:

   $.start.$ = cose.COSE_Key
   cose.COSE_Key = {
     1 => tstr / int,
     ? 2 => bstr,
     ? 3 => tstr / int,
     ? 4 => [+ tstr / int],
     ? 5 => bstr,
     * cose.label => cose.values,
   }
   cose.label = int / tstr
   cose.values = any

   In other words, the module synthesized from the command line had an
   empty CDDL file, which therefore was not provided (no – was given on
   the command line).

3.  Security Considerations

   The module structure specified in this document is not believed to
   create additional security considerations beyond the general security
   considerations in Section 5 of [RFC8610].

   Implementations that employ the module structure defined in this
   document need to ascertain the provenance of the modules they combine
   into the CDDL models they employ operationally.  This specification
   does not define how the source directories accessed via the
   CDDL_INCLUDE_PATH are populated; this process needs to undergo the
   same care and scrutiny as any other introduction of source code into
   a build environment; the possibility of supply-chain attacks on the
   modules imported needs to be considered.

   Specifically, implementations that rely on model-based input
   validation for enforcing certain properties of the data structure
   ingested (which, if not validated, could lead to malfunctions such as
   crashes and remote code execution) need to be particularly careful
   about the data models they apply, including their provenance and
   potential changes of these properties that upgrades to the referenced
   modules may (inadvertently or as part of an attack) cause.  More
   generally speaking, implementations should strive to be robust
   against limitations of the model-based input validation mechanisms
   and their implementations that they employ.

   In applications that dynamically acquire models and dereference
   module references in these, the security considerations of
   dereferenceable identifiers apply (see [I-D.bormann-t2trg-deref-id]
   for a more extensive discussion of dereferenceable identifiers).

   WS = SP
   SP = %x20
   CRLF = %x0A / %x0D.0A

Appendix B.  A CDDL Tool that Implements CDDL Module Structure

   This appendix is for information only.

   A CDDL conversion tool is available [cddlc] that can process module-
   structured CDDL models into basic CDDL models; the latter can then be
   processed by other CDDL tools such as the one described in Appendix F
   of [RFC8610].

   A typical command line involving both tools mentioned might be:

   cddlc -2 -tcddl mytestfile.cddl | cddl - gp 10

   The CDDL conversion tool can be installed on a system with a modern
   Ruby (Ruby version ≥ 3.0) via:

   gem install cddlc

   The present document assumes the use of cddlc of at least version
   0.2.5.
